# About Repository
## Dependencies
Our models need librosa, along with other libraries imported at the top of every ipynb files.
## Training Details
You can make your own dataset of audios or use Google, Mivia or Kaggle dataset for gunshot detection.
Your can aso download dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_H68GGKBqGsCxQVNZb8lxFy_apRUlhvF?usp=sharing
## Working with Trained Models
You can also write your own codes for the evaluation of our Trained Models.
## Realtime Simulation Codes
Realtime simulation codes are also included.
